The primary objective of the Real-Time Environmental Monitoring System is to develop a web application that enables users to monitor, analyze, and respond to environmental conditions—such as temperature, humidity, and air quality—in real-time across multiple locations.
By integrating IoT sensors, the system aims to provide accurate and timely data, facilitate historical trend analysis, and issue alerts when critical thresholds are exceeded, thereby supporting informed decision-making in various industries.
